# Elm Hangman

This small project is my (Tim Paisley) first attempt at building a basic app using the Elm language, and particularly the Elm architecture. Drawings by [Henrik Hedlund](https://github.com/hedlund).

## Resources

These are some of the resources I've found which helped me a lot in the process of learning Elm basics. It's worth noting that these resources are all in Elm v0.18.

### Tutorials

- [Official *Getting Started* Guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html)
- [Elm Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/izdi/elm-cheat-sheet)
- [*Elm Maybe - Dealing with null/Nothing*](http://rundis.github.io/blog/2016/elm_maybe.html)
- [*Learn Elm in Y Minutes*](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/elm/) - A very succinct, basic overview of the language

### Examples

- [Official Examples](http://elm-lang.org/examples)
- [Official Architecture Examples](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial)
- [*FCC TicTacToe In Elm*](https://github.com/iamim/fcc-tictactoe-in-elm) - A nicely written single player game, which I used for some guidance on structure given its similarities to Hangman
- [Recommended Structure for elm-test Testing](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-css/blob/master/tests/Tests.elm)

### Miscellaneous

- [*Ninety-nine Problems, Solves in Elm*](https://johncrane.gitbooks.io/ninety-nine-elm-problems/content/) - Great for practice on particular facets of the Elm language. I found the Learning Track particularly necessary to get the most out of it.
- [*Let's be mainstream!*](http://www.elmbark.com/2016/03/16/mainstream-elm-user-focused-design) - A talk by the creator/designer of Elm, gives some good insights into the methodologies and ideas behind the language.
